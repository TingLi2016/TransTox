# TransTox
### TransTox is an innovative AI model using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) technology to facilitate bidirectional translation of transcriptomic profiles between the liver and kidney under drug treatment.

- TransTox_generate_liver_kidney_train_test_set.py: TransTox used to generate transcriptomic profiles for liver and kidney in both training and test dataset.
- cosine.py: This script is used to calculate the cosine similarity between the real and generated transcriptomic profiles.
- rmse.py: This script is used to calculate the root-mean-square-error between the real and generated transcriptomic profiles.
- mape.py: This script is used to calculate the mean absolute percentage error between the real and generated transcriptomic profiles.
- umap.py: This script is used to calculate the two dimensional UMAP vectors for the real and generated transcriptomic profiles.
